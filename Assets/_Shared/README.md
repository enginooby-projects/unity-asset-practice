## What is this folder?
Basically - my own custom library/framework containing reusable components for developing different projects in Unity engine. \
Specifically, there are many common base classes, serializable classes, extension methods, interfaces, Monobehaviours, component operators (to manipulate Unity component in runtime), etc.\
In addition, the folder includes some of my favorite/must-have assets such as audio, fonts, icons, post processing profiles.
